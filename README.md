# CCL-Verification-Environment
A newly developed algorithm has to be thoroughly verified to ensure correctness. Applying only a set of test cases is by no means sufficient to conclude that an implementation is error free. In the case the new implementation is a functionally equivalent solution for the same problem, one can run both implementations, observe the outputs and report discrepancies. Verification based on software implementation is prohibitively costly in many cases pertinent to image processing. In this thesis, a comprehensive verification environment for FPGA architectures is used to run both implementations directly on a FPGA and make use of the massive parallel structure.  As a proof of concept for this verification methodology, a recently proposed image processing algorithm for Connected Component Labeling will be researched and validated by running it concurrently with a reference architecture. Though the reference architecture is not as fast, it is well established and based on the standard two pass algorithm.
